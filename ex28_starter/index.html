The first diatonic accordions were made early in the 1800's. They had one row of ten buttons in the right hand.<br />
      
For each note on the button board there are at least two reeds (and can be up to ten) with different pitched reeds for the "in" bellows and "out" bellows. The bass notes and relevant chords are the root of the scale for the in bellows and the fifth of the scale for the out bellows.<br />

Diatonics are frequently used by many folk and dance groups, because of their great sound output, simplicity, light weight and low cost. This makes them one of the most popular accordions worldwide. The note pattern of the keyboard is usually identical to the mouth harmonica.<br />

Concertinas have a unique shape, ranging from four to twelve sides (in cross-section). Concertinas have two keyboards, one at each end of the instruments bellows. There are no fixed chords on a concertina; all of the buttons are individual notes. The number of notes and systems vary so greatly that a player of one system will almost certainly not be able to pick up a concertina of a different system and play it without having to almost learn it from scratch. <br />

Each side of the instrument has its own finger, thumb or wrist strap and when in use it is usually supported on the knee. With compact size and light weight, the concertina can be visually entertaining, as players are able to move around with ease. This is one of the things that has made it very popular.<br />

The chromatic accordion was created in the 1850's by F. Walter, when he rearranged the reeds of a Three Row Diatonic. It could play a 46 note chromatic scale. The Chromatic Button Accordion is not diatonic, and probably has the greatest range of treble notes of any accordion available today. Their size ranges from an accordion with 20 treble keys and 12 bass buttons, to the modern Chromatic Button Accordions which have up to 6 rows of treble buttons and 160 bass buttons.<br />

The piano keyboard was first put on an accordion by Bouton of Paris in 1852. From that time until the early 1900's the piano accordion was not given much attention or development, but from 1910 onwards the piano accordion came into prominence almost worldwide.<br />
